Post-processing strategies for query results.
</p>
<p>
The results of a user defined query can be post-processed to extend
or reduce the result set. This allows the user to create queries that
cannot be expressed easily otherwise. The selected post-processing
strategies are executed after the user-defined query has been 
run. Since the strategies modify the result set, the order in which
the strategies are run is very important. The order number for every
post processing strategy is passed in the constructor.
