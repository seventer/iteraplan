<p>
This package contains and defines the available supporting (static) queries in iteraplan.
</p>
<p>
The queries are defined as subclasses of the AbstractPermissionQuery base class, which in turn 
implements the StaticQuery interface. Each subclass defines the complete logic for executing a 
query and its results as well as the configuration metadata for displaying the query on the GUI.

@since iteraplan 2.0
