<p>
This package contains and defines the available consistency checks in iteraplan.
</p>
<p>
The consistency checks are defined as subclasses of the AbstractConsistencyCheck base class,
which in turn implements the StaticQuery interface. Each subclass defines the complete logic 
for executing a consistency check and its results as well as the configuration metadata for 
displaying the check on the GUI.

@since iteraplan 2.0
