<p>
This package contains classes that can be used to describe a query.
</p>
<p>
User defined queries are described by using the classes in this package. A query
is represented as a graph that contains either leaf, operation or extension nodes.
Leaf nodes can for example be attributes of the queried type, opertion nodes are 
typically "and" and "or" operations and extension nodes are used for creating more
complex queries.
</p>
<p>
The presentation layer passes user defined queries to the business layer for evaluation.
This is done by the <code>QueryDAO</code>, which converts a query
representation into one or more Hibernate queries and returns the matching BuildingBlocks.
