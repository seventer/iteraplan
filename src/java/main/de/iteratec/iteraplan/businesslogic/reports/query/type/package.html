<p>
A meta model for the domain model used primarily for constructing user defined
queries.
<p>
For each <code>BuildingBlock</code> a <code>Type</code> exists that describes its attributes 
and its relations to other BuildingBlocks by an <code>Extension</code>. The types are 
used by the presentation tier to generate query forms for the different building blocks. 
The types are also used when passing a user defined query to the business logic.
