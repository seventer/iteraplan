<p>This package contains all iteraplan-specific ResponseGenerators that generate responses.</p>

<p>Response generators come into play whenever a download file should be sent to the client. 
A response generator packages the binary (or not) response byte stream into a properly formatted HTTP response. 
For instance, an Excel response generator will write the Excel file into the ServletOutputStream and set the headers accordingly.
</p>
<p>Response generators are typically created by the report generation logic which produces the download file/report.
</p>
<p>Response generators can have a state and should always created anew when one is needed.
