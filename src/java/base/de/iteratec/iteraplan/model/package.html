This package contains the iteraplan domain model.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
These classes are used thoughout the application and represent the iteraplan domain
model. 
</p>
<p>
These classes are used in combination with Hibernate to persist
the domain model data in the database. Each class is enriched with XDoclet 
"annotations" that contain information about the Hibernate mapping. Instances can
be loaded or persisted by the DAOs in the {@link de.iteratec.iteraplan.persistence.dao}
package. Upon loading an instance, Hibernate may enhances specified getters of 
the instance with proxies that allow dynamic loading of associated domain model
instances.
</p>
<p>
Each class contains a <code>update()</code> and a <code>validate()</code> method. These are used to
fill the instance with data from the presentation layer and to validate the instance
before saving it to the database.
