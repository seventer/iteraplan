Observe following hints when you update one of the software packages in this directory.

Apache Tomcat
---------------
 * Make sure to edit the included server.xml according to the iteraplan installation instructions.
   That means, all <Connector> elements must be amended with the attribute URIEncoding="UTF-8". 
   The full-text search feature will not work properly with special characters if you miss this step.
 * Strip down the contents of the Tomcat bundle. Tomcat ships with webapps with documentation etc. 
   which are not needed by iteraplan. Remove all web-apps except the ROOT directory from the webapps
   directory. This helps reduce the download size of iteraplan bundles.
 * Update the bundle.properties file whenever the file names for Tomcat or HSQLDB changed.
 
HSQLDB
--------------
 * There are typically no specialities to consider. Feel free to update this file if you find any.
