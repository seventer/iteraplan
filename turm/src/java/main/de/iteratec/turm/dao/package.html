This package contains Data Access Objects (DAOs) which provide access to the database.

The DAOs load the data from the database using plain SQL and return instances of classes
which are contained in the package {@link de.iteratec.turm.model}. The SQL statements are
written in a way so that they work with all supported databases: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and HSQLDB.
